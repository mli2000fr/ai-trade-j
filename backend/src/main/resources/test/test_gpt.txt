Overview / approach
I prioritized medium-term swing setups (days → a few weeks), risk management (explicit stop-loss + take-profit), and the portfolio constraint (very limited cash). Because you already hold all four tickers and cash is small (~$94), the most practical swing actions are to trim positions where technicals + news suggest higher downside risk or an opportunity to lock partial gains, and to hold the stronger setups. I avoid adding new buys (no cash) and I keep each trade overnight or longer per your rule.

CRSP — sell 30 shares (execute now at ~51.83; SL 56.00; TP 45.00)
- Key technicals: price is below the 30-period SMA (~57.76) and the 14‑day RSI is ~40 — momentum has turned negative. MACD is negative and trending down; ATR(14) ≈ 2.65 indicates ~$2.5–3 daily range (elevated volatility).
- News / sentiment: Mixed. CRSP has notable ARK/ETF interest stories (positive sentiment) but fundamentals are weak (loss-making, wide operating losses in the 10‑K). Recent institutional interest can lift volatility but does not remove the technical deterioration.
- Swing thesis & sizing: Trim ~30/97 shares (~31%) to reduce exposure and lock part of your position while the chart is weak. Selling now converts a portion of an underperforming/volatile name into dry powder to redeploy later after a clearer technical base or after earnings/sector catalysts.
- Stop / target logic: Entry ≈51.83. TP 45.00 is ~1.64 ATR below entry (gives a meaningful profit if the down‑move continues). SL 56.00 is ~4.17 above entry (~0.8 ATR above the recent SMA region) — risk ~4.17, reward ~6.83 → R/R ≈ 1.64:1 (meets the ≥1:1.5 guideline). Levels incorporate recent ATR-driven volatility and recent SMA/resistance.
- Portfolio impact: Selling 30 shares will free ~ $1.55k gross (before commissions). That meaningfully increases available capital for other swing ideas without closing the whole position (keeps a core holding in case of a reversal).

IONQ — hold (no action)
- Key technicals: price (~42.7) sits slightly above the 30‑day SMA (~41.0). RSI ~55 (neutral-to-modestly bullish). MACD histogram recently turned modestly positive after a period of weakness; ATR ≈2.4.
- News / sentiment: Largely constructive (new patents/IP, analyst upgrades and positive commentary; occasional unusual options activity). Momentum has been positive in recent weeks and analysts’ 12‑month targets were raised.
- Swing thesis: Trend and sentiment are more constructive than CRSP. With limited cash, it’s better to retain the current position rather than trimming further. I recommend monitoring for a pullback to the SMA (around low‑41s) as a potential re-entry or add level; if you want active risk management, set a mental stop near the 36–38 zone (rough guide — not an order here).
- Portfolio impact: Holding keeps exposure to a potentially bullish, news‑driven quantum name while you freed cash from the CRSP/LMND trims.

LMND (Lemonade) — sell 30 shares (execute now at ~52.90; SL 57.50; TP 46.00)
- Key technicals: LMND is above its 30‑day SMA (~48.57) and has regained momentum after a strong run; RSI is mid‑50s (recently hit overbought earlier but has cooled). ATR ≈3.24 (noticeable intraday movement).
- News / sentiment: Positive near‑term catalysts: earnings beat and raised guidance have driven recent strength and higher short‑interest stories and call activity — that increases both upside and whipsaw volatility. Analyst coverage is mixed but price momentum is favorable. Options sweeps show active positioning which can amplify moves.
- Swing thesis & sizing: Trim ~30/93 shares (~32%) to capture recent run‑up while leaving exposure to further upside. This locks profits and reduces the risk of being fully exposed into elevated implied/realized volatility.
- Stop / target logic: Entry ≈52.90. TP set at 46.00 to capture a pullback target (reward ≈6.90). SL 57.50 limits regret if the name keeps rallying (risk ≈4.60). Reward/risk ≈1.5:1 (aligned with the guideline). ATR is relatively large, so the stop is set wide enough to avoid being run over by normal intraday noise but tight enough to protect capital if momentum reverses.
- Portfolio impact: Selling 30 shares frees ~ $1.59k (gross). Combined with CRSP sale, you get significant swing capital while keeping a remaining core LMND stake for continued upside if the company keeps beating.

MQ (Marqeta) — hold (no action)
- Key technicals: MQ is trading above its 30‑period SMA (~6.04), RSI is mid/high 50s, MACD slightly positive. The name recently reacted positively to better-than-expected sales/guidance and the chart shows an uptick in momentum.
- News / sentiment: Recent beat + guidance lift and analyst upgrades drove a pop. That can extend a run, but it also invites profit‑taking and higher intraday volatility.
- Swing thesis: With current cash constraints and MQ’s recent strength, holding is appropriate. If you prefer active risk controls, consider a protective stop under the recent consolidation (approx low‑$5.50 area) or scale a small trim on intraday strength above $7.00. But because you still have a meaningful MQ position, keep it for continued upside while you redeploy cash freed from the two trims above.
- Portfolio impact: No immediate cash change. You preserve exposure to a stronger, fundamental/momentum-backed name.

Other notes, risk management & execution
- Commission/fees/taxes: I assumed none in sizing; adjust quantities slightly for commissions or tax considerations if needed.
- Volatility adjustments: I set stops and targets with ATR and recent SMA/RSI context in mind (wider stops where ATR is higher; targets produce R/R ≥1.5 where feasible).
- No buys recommended: Given your cash (~$94) and the rule not to use >90% of cash for buys, there was no practical buy opportunity without selling first. The sells I recommend create meaningful swing capital for redeployment into higher‑confidence setups when they appear.
- Holding period: These are medium‑term swings (days → weeks). After execution, recheck price action and news; if a name breaks the stop, re-assess promptly; if a take‑profit executes, consider a staged re-entry or reallocation.
- Why two trims rather than full sells: Keeps core exposure to upside while reducing risk and crystallizing gains/cash. That aligns with your “don’t be too defensive but manage risk” rule.

If you want, I can:
- Provide exact expected cash after fills (approx gross amounts) and suggested redeploy targets/levels for the freed cash; or
- Convert the sell trims into staggered / partial sales (e.g., 2 blocks with different limit prices) to improve execution.
