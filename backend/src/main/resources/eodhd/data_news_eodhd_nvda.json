    "content": "Want to buy an electric vehicle before the tax credit expires? New IRS guidance may give buyers a little extra breathing room to make the purchase. Yahoo Finance Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian explains in the video above.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Josh\n\nEV buyers are getting some wiggle room to claim tax credits after the September deadline from all of Yahoo Finance's senior reporter, Pras Subramanian. Pras.\n\n00:14 Pras Subramanian\n\nYeah, just a little bit of breathing room here for EV buyers. You know, the previous, well, the law, the OB, BB, B said that basically on September 30th, that the the the the credit would be going away. And if you didn't take delivery by then, you wouldn't get the credit. But now, the IRS has some new guidance, we're talking about how uh if you've a signed contract and you put down a deposit, you don't need to have take delivery by the 30th. You can actually take delivery at a later time and put it in use. You just have to file a a report with IRS saying that you actually bought the car, uh you complete a purchase of it before, but you receive delivery of it later. Uh so you know, that's that's a big deal because you know, we saw in July, the latest data we've seen EV sales resurging up 26% month over month and 20% year over year. So kind of lifting the EV market share to almost a 10%. So you know, that combined that that kind of level of sales means that inventory is falling and people might not be able to buy or get the get the car they want in time for that uh deadline. So what this gives them a bit more time uh and also more more money for EV companies to to sell their cars. So they get a little bit of an extension there with that with that deadline.\n\n02:20 Josh\n\nAll right. Thank you, Pras.

    "content": "Beverly Hills  California, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Danny Goldberg, workplace culture strategist and founder of multiple companies, joined host Patrice Bonfiglio on The Burnout Club Podcast to unpack his framework for building resilient, connected teams. The episode centered on Goldberg\u2019s \u201cBuild with Care\u201d model, an approach rooted in psychological safety, personal understanding and meaningful connection\u2014as a counter to widespread disengagement and burnout.\n\nGoldberg\u2019s insights stem from his personal journey, which began at age 14 when he launched a boxing gear business with support from his father, an industrial designer. He later co-founded Diamond MMA and built a global manufacturing firm working with major brands like Peloton, Traeger and Birchbox.\n\nReflecting on his early leadership experience, Goldberg described leading a multi-generational team across continents. \u201cI had to be hyper-intentional about our limited time together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe better I understood my people, the more committed they were when I left for home.\u201d\n\nToday, Goldberg helps organizations create psychologically safe environments where employees feel empowered to speak up, make mistakes and be themselves. \u201cWithout safety, nothing else matters,\u201d he stated. \u201cPeople won\u2019t innovate, and they won\u2019t stay.\u201d\n\nGoldberg noted that perks and surface-level benefits are no longer enough to retain top talent. \u201cPeople want to experience work as people, not just as a resource,\u201d he said. \u201cCare isn\u2019t a slogan; it\u2019s a strategy.\u201d\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of individualizing leadership, rather than relying on generational assumptions. \u201cWe should be asking what this person needs to thrive, not what a whole age group wants,\u201d he added.\n\nListeners walked away with actionable insights, including how to ask team members about their goals beyond work and the importance of breaking routine to foster authentic connection.\n\nGoldberg continues to speak and advise companies on building high-performing, people-centered cultures.\n\nAbout Danny Goldberg\r\nDanny Goldberg is a workplace culture expert and serial entrepreneur with a track record of scaling businesses and global teams. From launching his first business as a teenager to co-founding award-winning companies, Goldberg now helps organizations reduce burnout and increase engagement through his \u201cBuild with Care\u201d framework. More information is available at www.dannygoldbergspeaks.com.\n\nAbout The Burnout Club:\n\nThe Burnout Club Podcast is a community-driven platform that explores the intersection of professional success and burnout. Hosted by Patrice Bonfiglio, a seasoned hedge fund executive with nearly two decades of experience, the podcast delves into the realities of burnout in high-pressure environments.\n\nMedia Communications:\n\nadamtorres@missionmatters.com\n\nAttachment\n\nDanny Goldberg on the Burnout Club podcast with Patrice Bonfiglio.",

Preclinical data demonstrates vormatrigine is differentiated from standard of care, with the potential to be best-in-class for focal epilepsy. In vitro, vormatrigine has demonstrated superior selectivity for disease-state NaV channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of vormatrigine have demonstrated unprecedented potency in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model, a highly predictive translational model for efficacy in focal epilepsy. Data from the first cohort of patients with focal onset seizures in the RADIANT study demonstrated robust seizure reduction and a generally safe and well tolerated profile. To learn more about the POWER1 study, please visit POWER1 study.\n\nAbout Relutrigine (PRAX-562)\n\nRelutrigine is a first-in-class small molecule in development for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) as a preferential inhibitor of persistent sodium current, shown to be a key driver of seizure symptoms in severe DEEs. Relutrigine\u2019s mechanism of precision sodium channel (NaV) modulation is consistent with superior selectivity for disease-state NaV channel hyperexcitability. In vivo studies of relutrigine have demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of seizures up to complete control of seizure activity in SCN2A, SCN8A and other DEE mouse models. Relutrigine has been generally well-tolerated in three Phase 1 studies and has demonstrated biomarker changes indicative of NaV channel modulation. Data from cohort 1 of the Phase 2 EMBOLD study demonstrated a well-tolerated, robust, short- and long-term improvement in motor seizures in a heavily pre-treated population, alongside maintained seizure freedom in some patients with SCN2A- and SCN8A-DEE. Relutrigine has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE, SCN8A-DEE and Dravet syndrome; as well as Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD), and ODD from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE and SCN8A-DEE. To learn more about the EMERALD and EMBOLD studies, please visit ResilienceStudies.com.\n\nAbout Elsunersen (PRAX-222)\n\nElsunersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to selectively decrease SCN2A gene expression, directly targeting the underlying cause of early-seizure-onset SCN2A-DEE to treat seizures and other symptoms in patients with gain-of-function SCN2A mutations. In vitro studies of elsunersen have demonstrated reduction in both SCN2A gene expression and protein levels. In vivo, elsunersen has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent reduction in seizures, improvement in behavioral and locomotor activity and increased survival in SCN2A mouse models, with potential to be the first disease-modifying treatment for SCN2A-DEE. Elsunersen has received ODD and RPDD from the FDA, and ODD and PRIME designations from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of SCN2A-DEE. The elsunersen program is ongoing under a collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and RogCon, Inc. To learn more about the EMBRAVE study, please visit ResilienceStudies.com\/embrave.\n\nAbout Praxis\n\nPraxis Precision Medicines is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company translating insights from genetic epilepsies into the development of therapies for CNS disorders characterized by neuronal excitation-inhibition imbalance.

Now CEO Lip-Bu Tan has to have the Trump administration breathing down his neck at every corner while he attempts to save the company.\n\nAnd make no mistake, with this government investment, it's a signal that Intel needs saving.\n\nWhat KeyBanc had to say:\n\n\"We see positive implications associated with this transaction as we were previously concerned that the U.S. government's equity stake would likely have other Intel obligations with a potentially activist ownership role. Additionally, with the removal of the clawback on the previous CHIPS Act grant and announced equity transaction, uncertainty associated with whether INTC's Chips Act funding would be reneged is off the table.\" Today at 8:45 AM UTC\n\nKaren Friar\n\nThis week's Nvidia earnings, PCE inflation pose tests with stocks near records\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer lays out the potentially market-moving events to watch this week, after stocks ended last week in rally mode, thanks to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments.\n\nSchafer reports:\n\nRead more here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nView Comments",

    "title": "Inside Elon Musk's suit against Apple and OpenAI: 'This is a tale of two monopolists'",
    "content": "Elon Musk followed through on Monday with a warning to sue Apple (AAPL) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) over their agreement to integrate OpenAI\u2019s chatbot into Apple\u2019s operating systems and prioritize the chatbot in its app store.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in the Texas federal district court, Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup, xAI (XAAI.PVT), and his social media platform, X, alleged that the partnership between the iPhone maker and rival AI developer, OpenAI, violates laws against unfair competition.\n\n\u201cThis is a tale of two monopolists joining forces,\u201d Musk\u2019s companies alleged in the complaint, saying that Apple and OpenAI had \u201clocked up\u201d their respective monopolies in the smartphone market \u2014 and the market for generative AI-powered chatbots.\n\nApple couldn't immediately be reached for comment. OpenAI said, \u201cThis latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk\u2019s ongoing pattern of harassment.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, OpenAI controls at least 80% of the market for AI-powered chatbots. Apple, it claimed, holds a 65% share in the market for smartphones.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges unfair competition and multiple violations of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize the respective markets. It also alleges violations of Texas state competition law.\n\nIn June, during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced that OpenAI had agreed to make its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, exclusive to Apple devices on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. ChatGPT\u2019s integration is intended to enhance features that Apple offers through its voice command system, Siri, and its systemwide writing tools.\n\n\u201cThis means that if iPhone users want to use a generative AI chatbot for key tasks on their devices, they have no choice but to use ChatGPT,\u201d the lawsuit claims, even if the user would prefer to use chatbots such as xAI\u2019s Grok.Unfair to Grok? Elon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo\/Jose Luis Magana, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe lawsuit acknowledges that iPhone users can access generative AI chatbots other than ChatGPT by using their phone\u2019s web browser or by downloading a competing generative AI chatbot\u2019s app. However, the plaintiffs argue that those alternate options fail to offer the same level of usability and access to user prompts as ChatGPT\u2019s first-party integration.\n\nThe complaint claims that Apple colluded with OpenAI to make ChatGPT exclusive to its products in a belated attempt to hold on to its smartphone market monopoly. That monopoly, it claims, is under threat from AI innovations, like AI-powered \u201csuper apps\u201d meant to work across mobile devices.\n\n\u201cSuper apps, like those being developed by X and xAI, stand ready to upend the smartphone market and Apple\u2019s entrenched monopoly in it,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cAs Apple now recognizes, AI poses an existential threat to its business.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nMusk\u2019s companies contend that the partnership is also anticompetitive because generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok require continuous feedback loops in order to improve. With ChatGPT as Apple\u2019s exclusive provider, it can benefit from Apple\u2019s billions of user prompts that its iPhone users generate.\n\n\u201cMore users beget more prompts, and more prompts offer more opportunities to train the model, whose better features then attract even more users,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nThe suit reiterates Musk's claim earlier in August that Apple was unfairly promoting ChatGPT in its App Store.\n\n\"If not for its exclusive deal with OpenAI, Apple would have no reason to refrain from more prominently featuring the X app and the Grok app in its App Store,\" the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit references Apple\u2019s exclusive provider arrangements with Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which are at the heart of the US Justice Department's pending antitrust case against Google\u2019s search engine monopoly. The case, which Google lost last year, heavily turned on Google\u2019s exclusive contracts with Apple and other mobile device manufactures and browsers that positioned Google\u2019s search engine as the default search provider.\n\nIn a landmark decision by the federal district court for the District of Columbia, the judge overseeing the case ruled that Google used the default placement agreements to illegally dominate the search engine market, in violation of federal antitrust law.\n\nX and xAI are asking for a judge to permanently block Apple and OpenAI from carrying out the arrangement and for the companies to pay an unspecified amount in damages.\n\nYahoo Finance's Daniel Howley contributed to this report.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "content": "Investing.com -- Alberta, Canada\u2019s main oil-producing province, is exploring a potential financial investment in Japan\u2019s refining sector to diversify its oil export markets beyond the United States, according to Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Alberta government has initiated early-stage discussions with several Japanese crude oil refiners about a possible joint venture. Under consideration is funding for a coker unit that would enable Japanese refineries to process the heavy crude produced in Alberta\u2019s oil sands, two sources said.\n\nThis potential deal would mark Alberta\u2019s first energy infrastructure investment in a foreign country. The province is seeking to increase its oil exports following the opening of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion last year, which boosted Canada\u2019s capacity to ship oil through its Pacific Coast.\n\nA partnership with Japan would help secure oil flows through the Trans Mountain pipeline, Canada\u2019s only east-west oil pipeline, and strengthen Alberta\u2019s case for a new export pipeline that the provincial government is advocating for.\n\nThe discussions between Canada and Japan remain in very preliminary stages, with no agreements finalized yet, one source emphasized.",

    "title": "Markets are sure the Fed will cut in September, but the path from there is much murkier",
    "content": "Friday's booming rally turned into Monday's reality check as investors weighed just how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be on lowering interest rates and how the moves might impact the broader business and economic climate.\n\nChair Jerome Powell, in his annual address at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium, gave Wall Street hope of easier days ahead when he said conditions \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" which is generally seen as \"Fedspeak\" for cutting rates.\n\nStocks soared while Treasury yields plummeted on the news as the knee-jerk reaction took hold for a rate reduction when the Federal Open Market Committee issues its next decision on Sept. 17.\n\nHowever, cheer turned to caution Monday as market experts weighed what happens next, even if a move next month is baked in. Stocks were mostly lower and shorter-maturing Treasury yields, which are more sensitive to Fed action, moved higher.\n\n\"I'm on the slower side more than the faster side if the Fed, does go,\" said Jason Granet, chief investment officer at BNY. \"He definitely moved the door ajar, as opposed to kicked it wide open for September.\"\n\nTraders on Monday were pricing in a near-certainty of a September quarter percentage point reduction from the Fed's current target rate, currently around 4.3%. The implied probability of 82% was only slightly higher than a week ago but well above the 62% odds of a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure of futures prices.\n\nHowever, there is less certainty from there.\n\nPotential slow pace ahead\n\nThe implied probability for another cut in October was just 42%. That second cut is about fully priced in for December, but there's just a 33% expectation for three total moves this year.\n\n\"I think there's more to play for in the data between now and the September meeting,\" Granet said. \"So then the question will start to center around pace.\"\n\nSkeptics of a faster easing pace center their arguments around ongoing concerns about tariff-induced inflation and an economy that is holding up despite signs that the labor market is slowing.\n\n\"Although we are aware of the extreme political pressures on the Fed to ease, and we acknowledge cracks emerging in some labor market data, from our perch ... the case for cuts looks modest,\" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, said in a note. \"And we can't help but ask \u2014 what problem, exactly, does the Fed feel an urgency to solve?\"\n\nDespite the market pricing, Morgan Stanley sees just a 50% probability for a September reduction. The firm also cited uncertainty about inflation as well as the Fed's commitment to independence amid the heat from President Donald Trump and White House officials to lower rates.\n\nShalett also cautioned clients about putting too much faith in Fed easing for the next leg up in stocks as \"we question the impact of rate cuts in any case, given the reality that absent recession, an easing cycle is apt to be shallow while the interest rate sensitivity of the biggest economic agents has meaningfully declined.\"\n\nWorries over a repeat of 2024\n\nIndeed, there are ongoing questions about the impact of Fed rates in the current climate.\n\nAt this time a year ago, the central bank entered an easing mode that ended up having unintended consequences \u2014 an inverse move in Treasury yields and mortgage rates pushed by worries that the Fed might be taking its foot off the brake too soon along with expectations for stronger economic growth.\n\nThat's the kind of consideration that has market veteran Ed Yardeni wondering about the wisdom of another round of cuts as he worries that Powell might be wrong about the temporary impulse of inflation from Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The Fed won't listen to me. Of course, they'll do what they're going to do,\" the head of Yardeni Research said Monday on CNBC. \"The cautious tale is what happened last year when the Fed lowered by 100 basis points and the bond yield went up 100 basis points.\"\n\nShould that happen again, it would thwart the White House's hopes for lower financing costs on the national debt and a boost for the housing market through lower mortgage rates.\n\nOn the bright side, though, Yardeni thinks the equity market rally will get a boost from rate cuts, and he is maintaining his bullish view on stocks even in the face of a potential policy mistake. Yardeni thinks the S&P 500 could add another 2% from here to close the year around 6,600, then climb another 14% in 2026 to close at 7,500.\n\n\"I think we're going to have a continuation of the bull market, but I think it's going to be earnings led,\" he said. \"If the Fed does go ahead and lower rates on Sept. 17, I think my targets may be too conservative right now.\"\n\nDon\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\n\nMorgan Stanley says nuclear power is gaining momentum, recommends these stocksWells Fargo hikes S&P 500 target as U.S. tariffs get delayed againMorgan Stanley maintains bullish stance on Nvidia heading into earnings, raises price targetWhy UBS just raised its gold forecast again as the precious metal hovers near record high",

    "title": "Despite delivering investors losses of 29% over the past 5 years, Columbia Sportswear (NASDAQ:COLM) has been growing its earnings",
    "content": "The main aim of stock picking is to find the market-beating stocks. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Columbia Sportswear Company (NASDAQ:COLM), since the last five years saw the share price fall 34%. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 32% in the last year. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 15% in the last 90 days. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nThe recent uptick of 5.0% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Columbia Sportswear actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 8.5% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\n\nDue to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.\n\nRevenue is actually up 5.8% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).NasdaqGS:COLM Earnings and Revenue Growth August 25th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Columbia Sportswear will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Columbia Sportswear's TSR for the last 5 years was -29%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nColumbia Sportswear shareholders are down 31% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 5% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Columbia Sportswear  (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.\n\nBut note: Columbia Sportswear may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

    "title": "New National Survey: Poor Economic Conditions Hampering Community Improvement",
    "content": "ST. LOUIS, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new national survey of organizations serving low- to moderate-income communities indicates poor economic conditions led by lack of affordable housing and personal finance difficulties.\n\nRespondents to The Community Perspectives Survey: Insights from the Field gave slightly more positive ratings on employment and education conditions, driven by the ability to find work and uptake of adult education programs.\n\n\u201cWhile the survey did not specifically ask about uncertainty, it was a broad theme raised by respondents in open ended questions that was affecting communities, businesses and entities negatively,\u201d said report coauthor Nishesh Chalise, senior manager of community development at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nThe survey of 440 representatives of organizations serving low- to moderate-income communities was conducted in April and May by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe main findings include:\n\nEconomic Mobility: Almost 60% of respondents noted conditions were having a downward effect on economic mobility at the time of the survey, and almost 70% expect conditions to worsen over the next year due to challenges such as housing but also expectations around increasing demand for services with continued funding uncertainty for service providers.\n\nEmployment: Respondents reported labor market conditions were better than other sectors; however, slightly more than half expect unemployment to worsen over the next year.\n\nHousing: Conditions for housing were rated among the worst in the areas addressed in the survey, and few respondents expect any improvement in housing conditions over the coming year.\n\nPersonal Finance: Low- to moderate-income (LMI) populations were largely seen as having poor financial stability at the time of the survey, and most respondents do not expect that to improve, mostly due to income not keeping up with the cost of living and debt.\n\nSmall Business: Overall, respondents said conditions for small business were poor, with nearly two-thirds expecting the conditions to worsen in the coming year primarily driven by rising operational costs.\n\nHealth: Most survey respondents rated public health conditions as poor, while slightly more than 40% rated access to health care as poor, with insurance coverage and mental health needs as the main challenges. Less than 20% of respondents expect health care conditions and access to improve.\n\nEducation: Around 45% of respondents noted poor conditions for both pre-K to 12th-grade and adult education. However, a much larger share of respondents expect improvement in adult education than in pre-K to 12th grade, driven by participation in training programs and employer partnerships.\n\nHuman Services and Emergency Assistance: Over half of respondents noted conditions were poor, with nearly 80% expecting conditions to worsen over the next year. Overall economic conditions and funding were mentioned as negative factors.\n\nDigital Skills and Internet and Technology Access: Over half of the respondents said internet access was poor. A quarter reported improvements compared to last year, and they expect it to continue improving over the next year. There was concern regarding over-reliance on cell phones, which could hinder development of digital skills.\n\nTo read more in-depth results of the survey, visit this link.\n\nAbout Federal Reserve Community Development \r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve seeks to promote the economic resilience and mobility of individuals and communities throughout the U.S., including low- and moderate-income and underserved households. Increasing economic opportunity is not only good for individuals and communities but also vital to the overall economy.",

    "title": "Government's Intel stake highlights risks of 'deals-based capitalism,' former Treasury Secretary says",
    "content": "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers expressed skepticism over the US government's decision to take a 10% equity stake in Intel (INTC), warning that the move reflects a troubling shift in how economic policy is being carried out.\n\nThe stake comes as Washington steps up efforts to boost the domestic semiconductor industry. While Summers acknowledged the logic of public funds supporting struggling companies, he cautioned that the Intel deal fits into a broader \u2014 and, in his view, problematic \u2014 pattern.\n\n\"It comes as part of a general approach to [economic] policy, what you might call deals-based capitalism rather than rules-based ... capitalism,\" he said.\n\nSummers argued that a rules-based approach, where companies compete under consistent standards rather than striking case-by-case deals with regulators, is more conducive to long-term growth and market stability.\n\nNasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n24.67\n\n-0.13\n\n(-0.52%)\n\nAs of 3:25:33 PM EDT. Market Open.  Advanced Chart\n\nRecent government interventions raise questions about fairness, consistency, and long-term market impacts, Summer noted. These examples include the government taking a stake in US Steel in exchange for regulatory approval, as well as agreements with law firms after threats that they would lose access to federal buildings.\n\nThe Intel move touches off a larger debate about the government's role in shaping the future of critical industries like semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company has faced years of execution challenges, ceding market share to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Its turnaround efforts have required heavy government support, including subsidies from the CHIPs and Science Act.Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 9, 2025, in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Kevin Dietsch\/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nSummers, who also serves on the board of directors of OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), said he doesn't want to prejudge the details of the Intel deal \"without understanding things better,\" but he did stress the risks of blurring the line between market competition and political negotiation.\n\nFor investors, uncertainty grows when policy decisions in Washington increasingly shape the future of US tech companies. That has been the case for Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD. The two companies are in a revenue-sharing arrangement with the US government, where they are required to pay 15% of their revenue from specific AI chip sales to China to secure export licenses.\n\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

    "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Monday indicated it would appeal a judge\u2019s ruling barring Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, from supervising federal cases as New Jersey\u2019s top federal prosecutor.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania on Thursday found that Habba was unlawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, deeming improper a series of procedural maneuvers the Trump administration undertook to extend her 120-day interim tenure.\n\nThe ruling, which prevented Habba from overseeing criminal cases brought by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, has thrown hundreds of active criminal cases in New Jersey into doubt. Federal District Court judges in New Jersey previously declined to extend Habba\u2019s interim term and instead named her top deputy as her successor.\n\nThe Trump administration then fired that official, Desiree Grace, and preemptively removed her as U.S. attorney, seeking to reinstall Habba as the acting U.S. attorney. Brann found that those moves violated U.S. laws governing federal appointments. <\/p>",

    "content": "Investing.com -- Iris Energy Limited (NASDAQ:IREN) stock rose 8% Monday after the company announced it has procured an additional 4,200 NVIDIA Blackwell B200 GPUs, effectively doubling its total GPU fleet to approximately 8,500 NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nThe company purchased the additional B200 GPUs for approximately $193 million, including ancillary equipment. Iris Energy also secured $102 million in financing for a prior purchase of NVIDIA Blackwell B200 and B300 GPUs, structured as a 36-month lease for the full purchase price with lease payments calculated at a high single-digit interest rate.\n\nThe newly acquired B200 GPUs will be installed at the company\u2019s Prince George campus, while total installed mining capacity is expected to remain at approximately 50 EH\/s through efficient utilization of spare data center capacity at other sites.\n\nWith the expansion, Iris Energy\u2019s AI Cloud will consist of 800 NVIDIA H100s, 1,100 NVIDIA H200s, 5,400 NVIDIA B200s, and 1,200 NVIDIA B300s. The company noted that its Prince George campus, with 50MW of total power capacity, can support phased growth to approximately 20,000 Blackwell GPUs.\n\nDaniel Roberts, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Iris Energy, stated that the expanded Blackwell capacity positions the company to capture strong demand and drive the next phase of its AI Cloud revenue growth, adding that utilizing competitively priced, non-dilutive capital further strengthens the value proposition in scaling the AI Cloud business.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

    "content": "Baltimore, MD, Aug.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A newly revealed briefing highlights Elon Musk\u2019s role at the center of what\u2019s being described as the most ambitious technology project of the modern era: the creation of an AI Mothership.\n\nAccording to the report, Musk is poised to alter the trajectory of America\u2019s economy and security in ways few are prepared for. \u201cThe world\u2019s richest man\u2026 about to change America \u2014 forever,\u201d  the document states.\n\nWhat the AI Mothership Represents\n\nThe presentation explains that Musk\u2019s plan is not about incremental innovation, but about a singular hub of artificial superintelligence capable of outpacing every prior breakthrough.\n\nThe scale of the potential transformation is staggering: \u201cIt has been estimated that artificial intelligence will create $20 trillion in new wealth PER YEAR by the year 2030.\u201d Scientists cited in the report go even further, suggesting the rise of AI could yield \u201cmassive windfalls of $14 QUADRILLION over the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nThe Human Driver Behind the Machine\n\nWhile the concept of artificial superintelligence has been discussed in theory for years, Altucher argues that the decisive factor now is the individual leading it. In his words: \u201cBut today, I am making a new trillion-dollar prediction. And it\u2019s not on a single company\u2026 But on a single man \u2014 Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nUnlike past eras of innovation, where platforms or corporations defined change, this shift is tied directly to Musk\u2019s personal vision, capital, and network of companies.\n\nA Broader Impact on Society\n\nThe presentation suggests the ripple effects of Musk\u2019s AI mothership will not be confined to Silicon Valley or Wall Street. Instead, it forecasts broad impacts across infrastructure, defense, and personal freedoms.\n\n\u201cThis ability to glean into the future \u2014 and see trends my peers often can\u2019t \u2014 has helped me stay ahead of some of the biggest tech stories of our time,\u201d Altucher explains, positioning Musk\u2019s project as the next and largest in that line of stories.\n\nWhy This Matters Now\n\nThe release frames Musk\u2019s AI mothership not as a far-off concept but as a present and active undertaking with the potential to reset the balance of technological power. With resources at his disposal unmatched in modern history, Musk is positioned to direct the largest leap in artificial intelligence to date.\n\nThe report concludes: \u201cThis is developing \u2014 rapidly. So, time is of the essence.\u201d\n\nAbout James Altucher\n\nJames Altucher is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, bestselling author, and venture capitalist. He managed millions on Wall Street, launched successful hedge funds, and became one of the first to design early AI trading software. Known for correctly predicting the rise of Bitcoin, Facebook, and Apple years before mainstream recognition, Altucher now issues his boldest call yet \u2014 centered on Elon Musk and the dawn of artificial superintelligence.",

    "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Nova implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 10 shareholders own 52% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nA look at the shareholders of Nova Ltd. (NASDAQ:NVMI) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nova.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Nova NasdaqGS:NVMI Ownership Breakdown August 25th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nova?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Nova does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Nova's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.NasdaqGS:NVMI Earnings and Revenue Growth August 25th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Nova is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is FMR LLC with 9.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Nova\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data cannot confirm that board members are holding shares personally. Not all jurisdictions have the same rules around disclosing insider ownership, and it is possible we have missed something, here. So you can click here learn more about the CEO.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

    "title": "Insider report: The stocks with the biggest recent sales by executives from Circle Internet, Zillow, Applovin and more",
    "content": "A flurry of stock sales were made in names such as Circle Internet Group and Zillow Group last week as company executives and other corporate insiders offloaded their shares. Insider selling is followed by traders who expect the activity could point to deeper troubles at a company, though the motivations can vary. VerityData tracks the information, which is confirmed against the original Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The list excludes filings where the disclosure explicitly says the sale was conducted pursuant to preplanned 10b5-1 trading plans. Instead, the focus is on discretionary activity. Here are some of the most notable sales from the last week. Circle Internet Group CEO Jeremy Allaire sold 358,000 shares at an average price of $127.08 for a total of $45.5 million, according to regulatory filings . The sale reduced his holdings by 2%, and was made as part of the company's secondary offering . Circle , one of the earliest companies in the cryptocurrency industry, issues USD Coin, the second largest stablecoin in the world. Circle priced its IPO at $31, and shares shot up 168% on its first day of trading on June 5. Since then, the stock has been highly volatile. The secondary offering put pressure on the stock, and it has fallen more than 20% since it was announced on Aug. 12. Shares are trading 57% below the June high. CRCL 3M mountain Circle, over three months Zillow Group Zillow Group co-executive chairman and President Richard Barton sold 350,000 shares at an average price of $85.25 for a total of $29.8 million. The sale reduced holdings by 6%. What's more, co-executive chairman Lloyd Frink sold 250,000 shares at an average price of $85.00 for a total of $21.3 million. Barton and Frink sold outside their typical 10b5-1 trading plans, according to a note from Verity. Barton's last sale outside of a trading plan was 2017. Zillow shares are up nearly 25% quarter to date. Applovin Arash Adam Foroughi, chief executive at the mobile technology company, sold 178,000 shares at an average price of $418.78 for a total of $74.3 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 2%. Applovin shares are up 29% since the quarter began. Monolithic Power Systems Monolithic Power Systems CEO Michael Hsing sold 20,000 shares at an average price of $829.10 for a total of $16.8 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 2%. Verity notes this was a step-out sale after Hsing terminated a 10b5-1 trading plan, his first non-planned sales since 2019. Cardinal Health Cardinal Health CEO Jason Hollar sold 143,000 shares of the global health-care services and products company at an average price of $149.19 for a total of $21.4 million, securities filings show. The sale reduced holdings by 31.3%. Shares are slightly down, by 4%, over the past three months, but are up 24% year to date. . Verity notes a number of executives' sales coincide with stock award vestings: Eight executives, including CEO Jason Hollar, sold at $149.09 following vestings, a negative development as\u00a0shares of the healthcare conglomerate\u00a0have pulled back to levels\u00a0within\u00a0~10% of their July all-time high. The activity\u00a0marks\u00a0the third such year that insiders have\u00a0sold their post-vesting stock but this period stands out as it's accelerated each year at successively higher prices. CAH YTD mountain Cardinal Health, year to date Hollar led the activity\u00a0as he sold 143,600 shares for\u00a0$21.4 million, which compares\u00a0with the 170,900 post-tax shares that vested days earlier, and leaves him with 27,300 shares retained from the vesting. CFO Aaron Alt sold 48,200 shares for $7.2 million, accelerating far above his post-vesting sale from last year and selling beyond the 42,800 post-tax shares that vested recently. While the CEO's sales were in line with his vestings,\u00a0each of the others sold beyond the shares that vested this quarter,\u00a0and\u00a0that acceleration near the all-time high leaves us a bit cautious of Cardinal. Willdan Group Thomas Brisbin, director at Willdan Group , sold 125,000 shares of the the technical and consulting services firm to utilities companies, at an average price of $109.58 for a total of $13.7 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 28%. Verity noted that Chairman and former CEO Thomas Brisbin has led selling by four insiders in unusual multi-insider activity this quarter as shares of the technical and consulting services company have risen dramatically over the last several months, surging to new all-time highs. Willdan shares are up 126% over the past three months. Brisbin, who retired as CEO at the end of 2023, cut his non-option holdings by 28% with his sale at no less than $108 and he tacked on an option sale. He has routinely sold short-life options but his deviations to sell non-option shares have been timely, including a sale in November 2024 at $42.49 near a peak. Informatica Informatica CEO Amit Walia sold 508,000 shares of the enterprise cloud data management leader at an average price of $24.71 for a total of $12.6 million. The sale reduced his holdings by 20%. Shares are up about 10% over the past three months. Robinhood Robinhood CFO Jason Warnick, chief financial officer at the trading platform, sold 100,000 shares at an average price of $110.93 for a total of $11.1 million. The sale reduced Warnick's holdings by 16%. Shares are up almost 72% over past three months.",

    "content": "Investing.com -- Olaplex Holdings (NASDAQ:OLPX) stock surged 12% Monday after receiving its first buy rating from Wall Street analysts, marking a potential turning point for the prestige beauty brand.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Susan Anderson upgraded Olaplex from Hold to Buy and raised her price target to $2.00 from $1.50, representing a 43% upside from Friday\u2019s closing price of $1.40. This makes Anderson the sole bullish voice among approximately nine firms covering the stock.\n\nIn her upgrade note, Anderson cited a \"brand reinvigoration\" at Olaplex, suggesting the company is \"ready to shine as a highly profitable prestige beauty brand set to return to growth.\" She highlighted the company\u2019s journey since its IPO, which saw sales initially grow at triple-digit rates to over $700 million annualized before normalizing to its current $400+ million run rate.\n\nThe analyst noted that after 2.5 years of normalization, Olaplex is finally seeing sales and margins stabilize. The company reported sales growth in the second quarter and could potentially return to positive annual growth in fiscal year 2025. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margins are settling at industry-standard low-20% rates, down from previous levels exceeding 60%.\n\nOlaplex\u2019s stock movement reflects growing confidence that investments in marketing, merchandising, and innovation are beginning to yield results for the hair care brand.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

    "title": "Nvidia's Big Week: Earnings Loom as China Deal Clears Path",
    "content": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nNvidia (NVDA, Financials) is walking into Wednesday's earnings with a lot on the line and Wall Street firmly in its corner. Analysts expect the AI chipmaker to deliver another monster quarter, projecting $46.45 billion in sales and $1.02 in adjusted EPS. That's more than 50% growth from a year ago.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. Is NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe big subplot: China. Earlier this year, Nvidia warned it could lose as much as $8 billion in sales thanks to U.S. export restrictions, even taking a $4.5 billion charge tied to its H20 chips. Those processors, reworked to meet U.S. rules, still pulled in $17 billion last year about 13% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\nNow, a fresh deal with the Trump administration gives Nvidia a way forward. In exchange for handing over 15% of China H20 sales, the company can keep shipping chips into the country. That compromise not only preserves a key market, it also tees up Nvidia's next move: a new China-only processor, the B30A. Built on Blackwell architecture but intentionally dialed down to about half the power of the flagship B300, the chip looks designed to walk the fine line between Washington's red lines and Beijing's demand.\n\nThe stakes are big. China's AI chip market is estimated at $50 billion a year. Even with scaled-back hardware, Nvidia could claim a large piece of that pie.\n\nInvestors aren't hiding their optimism. Of 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 12 rate Nvidia a buy. Price targets range as high as $225, well above Friday's close around $178. Morgan Stanley, UBS and Wedbush all bumped their numbers higher in recent weeks, citing unstoppable AI demand.\n\nThe stock has already seen wild swings this year a 37% drop from record highs, followed by a roaring comeback. Heading into earnings, Nvidia sits just 4% below its all-time peak. A beat-and-raise on Wednesday could be the spark for another rally.\n\nBottom line: Nvidia is still the face of the AI boom. If its China workaround holds and Blackwell chips keep flying off the shelves, investors betting big may get paid off again.\n\nView Comments",

    "title": "Nvidia Faces New China Risks -- Should Investors Stay the Course?",
    "content": "Key Points\n\nNvidia took a huge inventory charge in the first quarter because it was not able to sell its H20 chips in China. The company appears to have solved its export license issues with the U.S., but Beijing has new concerns. Nvidia reports earnings after the closing bell on Aug. 27.10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a\n\nIf you're an Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) investor, then you're familiar with the roller coaster that comes with Nvidia stock -- the ups and downs as Washington and Beijing duke it out, with Nvidia and its shareholders caught in the middle.\n\nAugust 22 brought another unexpected drop that may be leaving some investors shell-shocked. But I don't think it's worth getting off this ride now -- particularly as Nvidia's all-important quarterly earnings are around the corner.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe backdoor issue\n\nThe new developments are connected to Nvidia's H20 high-functioning chips, which the company had made specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The chips have been in the news a lot this year. You may remember that in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia disclosed it took a $4.5 billion inventory charge because export restrictions prevented it from selling the H20 chips.\n\nThen this summer, Nvidia struck a deal with the Trump administration that would open the Chinese markets to them in exchange for 15% of revenues from the H20 sales.\n\nWhile the export restrictions seem to be handled, Nvidia is now facing additional problems from Beijing. China reportedly asked tech companies and AI developers not to use the H20 chips, particularly for government purposes. Beijing also approached Nvidia to ask if the chips have tracking technology that would allow them to be operated remotely. CEO Jensen Huang said the company assured the Chinese government that backdoors do not exist, but the discussions are continuing.\n\n\"As you know, [Beijing] requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s, for some time and I've worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses, and so hopefully this will be resolved,\" he told reporters in Taiwan, according to CNBC.\n\nMedia outlet The Information reported Friday that Nvidia is now asking some of its suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung. Reuters reported that Nvidia also asked Foxconn to stop H20 production.\n\nThat's news that could frighten investors -- Nvidia stock is up over 30% so far this year, and sentiment has been high that the resumption of H20 sales could further fuel returns.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nEarnings are around the corner\n\nNvidia and Huang will surely have a lot to say about the H20 issue when Nvidia reports its fiscal 2026 Q2 earnings after the closing bell on Aug. 27. Analysts at Yahoo! Finance are expecting earnings per share of $1.01, versus $0.68 per share a year ago. The consensus revenue estimate is $46.12 billion, up 53% from the same quarter a year ago.\n\nNvidia is a powerhouse because of its overwhelming power in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it's estimated to have more than 90% of the market share. And as some of the company's biggest customers said they intend to increase spending in their data centers to further power the AI and advanced computing platforms, Nvidia appears to be in a solid position for this week's report -- even without the Chinese H20 sales.\n\nIn fact, I'm suggesting that Nvidia's plan to scale back production, even temporarily, is a good one. The company already has billions of dollars in H20 inventory and took a huge charge in the first quarter because it wasn't able to move the product. Why keep building when roadblocks keep popping up in Washington and now Beijing?\n\nAnalysts surely aren't concerned. In fact, many increased their price targets on Nvidia stock in recent days.

Finance\n\nI'm fully expecting a solid earnings report on Aug. 27, but like other investors, I'll be keenly interested in the H20 developments. When Nvidia is finally able to freely sell in China, it will be another tailwind for the biggest publicly traded company on the planet. But it's not the only positive catalyst for Nvidia stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Now in its eighth year, David, thank you for the invitation and for appropriately setting expectations at the beginning of last week's episode, when you told your listeners, I would be here hosting the show, and you said, and I just hope we don't screw it up. I thought, Oh, that's exactly how I feel, as well.\n\nDavid Gardner: Chris, I'm so honored to have you in that chair this week. You and I talked briefly about this. I think in the now 11th year of hosting a weekly podcast, I've never once given away the host chair. We did co-hosts at least once. We've done some memorable things together on this podcast. But if I were to think, who would I want to host this podcast in my absence on any given week, I could easily imagine the host of money unplugged, but this particular week, to have you interview me about my book is really special. Thank you.\n\nChris Hill: It's my pleasure. David, typically, when you are talking with authors, you are asking questions about their origin, where they grew up, all that thing. I'm going to go ahead and assume that a fair number of people listening right now are familiar with some of the broader strokes of your origin story of growing up in Washington, DC, learning about investing from your father. But specific to this new book you've written, I would like to drill down on a specific time period because you've talked and written about your father invests from when you were born in 1966, and in 1984, you turn 18, and he hands you the portfolio and says, Here you go. This is now your portfolio. What I'm curious about is the subsequent decade. From 1984 to, let's just say 1994, when the seeds of Rule Breaker Investing are planted, you know, maybe showing some green shoots. But that's not the sort of thing that I imagine happened overnight. You get this portfolio from your father. Obviously, you're 18-years-old. He's a mentor to you in more ways than one. You're going to check in with him about the decisions you make, but it's your decision to make. Do you start selling positions that first year? Do you start looking at this collection of stocks and think to yourself, Boy, I don't know. I don't know that This seems like a fine company for the past 20 years, but I don't know that I want this for the next 20.\n\nDavid Gardner: There was definitely some of that, Chris, and I appreciate you starting there. I think the first thing that I did, which probably slightly surprised Dad, but he was still supportive, is I moved the account. It had been at a long standing, well known bank. The broker that we both used to call in our trades had been in his wedding, and I'm like, Dad, I'm actually going to move this to Schwab, because there's this new thing, discount brokerages, and they charge less. This old line bank that you've been using since your wedding, they're actually charging me not just quite a lot for commissions, but there's, like, annual semi annual maintenance fees that just come out of nowhere that are a percent of assets. I think I can do better. I moved the account to Schwab, and it still sits there years later. I was definitely changing it up, but having inherited from my father really good understanding around business focused investing, something that you know so well, Chris, something that we've talked about at the Motley Fools. Since we launched in 1994 on AOL, we're really focused on the businesses themselves, and Dad had stocked the portfolio with good businesses. I will say that I did end up selling the largest position a few years later. It was the Washington Post Company and phenomenal company. Of course, the product was on our doorstep every morning waking up as kids. By what you know, he was exemplifying that for us. But AOL was oncoming. I was kind of like, I think AOL maybe is a better place to put this money than the Washington Post. Even though I'd gotten to meet Warren Buffett at a Washington Post annual meeting. There were, you know, the Graham family phenomenal company. But I did start shaking up the portfolio a little bit myself, which I think he wanted us to do as his kids.\n\nChris Hill: Do you consider AOL to be the first rule Breaker stock that you ever bought? I mean, it certainly has many of the qualities and first mover advantage, that sort of thing. I mean, it was for those who don't remember, in the 1990s, AOL definitely passes the snap test. I'm curious if it was that's your first rule Breaker stock or was it something else?\n\nDavid Gardner: It really was my first rule Breaker stock. I wouldn't have used that phrase at the time because I didn't yet know what rule Breaker investing was or would be, but it was such a great exemplar. To me, the future me looking back, realizing the traits that AOL possessed as a company and as a stock were just so Rule Breakery and it was a phenomenal investment. I had made previous investment, Chris. When I took over at 18, I didn't just, I did eventually sell that Washington Post and go into America online, but that was more me in my 20s. Some of my early moves were into what I would call and have called faker breakers, like, companies that look like they're going to be breaking the rules, but don't end up great. TCBY, do you remember the country's best yogurt?\n\nChris Hill: Absolutely.\n\nDavid Gardner: Of course you do. You and I are of a certain age, and it's healthier than ice cream. It's expanding. It's franchised. They're coming out of Little Rock, Arkansas, and it was a phenomenal stock in the summer of 1986. I think it went up 50%, split three for two, went up 50% again, slit three for two again. I cared about stock splits more back then than I do now. It didn't endit was a good concept at the time, but not a timeless concept. There ended up being a lot of competition. I had stocks that I thought were going to be monsters, but nothing ever emerged in the way that AOL did, and I learned a lot from its rise.\n\nChris Hill: When do you start to put some of these pieces together, and more importantly, than when, I'm curious how you start putting them together, because as you just said, you're making these decisions, you're getting experience of stocks that appear to do well and then turns out the underlying business crumbles for one reason or another. How do you start figuring out, these are the types of things I'm looking for in companies, beyond the solid business fundamentals that you learned about from your dad?\n\nDavid Gardner: That part about how companies can sometimes crumble after we bought them, that continues to be true for me in my 50s, just as it was in my 20s Peloton. The list goes on of, you know, companies that haven't fulfilled what I was hoping for from them. That's an important part of Rule Breaker investing, and I definitely include that in the book. But I think for me, Chris, it was an experience, first of all, picking stocks in front of an online public audience, AOL back in the day. We weren't charging. We didn't have charge services back then. You were with us as early as back then, we had a few books coming out. We had a newspaper column. We had a radio show. There were ways we could get paid. We had AOL dial up fees. People were still paying $4 an hour to come online. We got 10% of that at keyword Fool. There were ways to make money, but the act of picking stocks being accountable to an anonymous global public. At an early age was, no doubt, such an important thing for both Tom and me and you and all of us who are in our 20s or early 30s starting on this new medium and picking stocks. I think that for me, the magnet moment was when I missed one, and I decided that's going to be the last one I ever miss. Here's in a nutshell what happened. Yahoo looked to me like a great stock, a great company. It was pre Google. Yahoo, as you'll remember, was dominant. It was at $29 a share. I decided running my own valuation scheme, my own research, that it was only worth not 29 but 25.5. I'm like, Okay, I will recommend Yahoo when it gets down to my price, which I think is a fair price of 25.5. It's overvalued right now at 29. History will show that Yahoo never did make it down to 25.5. Instead, it basically went to 1,000 over the succeeding five years. I watched a stock that I had at 30, and I never none our readers did either.\n\nNone of our Fool community enjoyed the incredible 30 bagger rise of Yahoo. It was all premised on me going, It's a little overvalued. It doesn't hit what I'm looking for, so I'm not going to buy. Once that happened, when you miss a 30 bag or something that you felt good about, you thought you were in the right space, and it was just a minor valuation concern. I said, I'm not going to make that mistake again. But one thing I did learn from that, and it's steadied us well ever since you've already used the phrase, looking for companies that are top dogs and first movers in important emerging industry you really should overpay for those companies almost every time. You're going to have some losers. Some of them Peloton, don't work out, but the ones that do work out so fantastically that they wipe out all your losers. For me, Chris, that was, like, the iconic I missed it in front of a worldwide membership that never got to enjoy the rise of that stock because I decided it was a little overvalued.\n\nChris Hill: I want to highlight a couple of things in the book and have you expand on a 2025 version of something that you've written about. One of the things you write about that I appreciate is you take a little bit of time to remind us of the conventional wisdom of the 1990s and early 2000s that in hindsight, look ridiculous. But at the time, they were bedrock belief systems. I mean, I remember being with you when you were doing an interview on television, and the majority of people are skeptical of online commerce. Who in their right mind is going to type their credit card information into a website? That's absurd. That's not safe. Again, in hindsight, it's hilarious. At the time, that's what you were fighting against. I'm curious, is there a bit of conventional wisdom that you see right now, whether it's a specific industry, a trend, a specific company that you find yourself on the other side of thinking, I don't think this conventional wisdom is correct.\n\nDavid Gardner: Well, I guess, mainly when I think about that, I think about things that people are pessimistic about. Those are the areas that I find myself most interested in because as a lifelong optimist, I have generally found myself rewarded when I believe something will happen and be good and everybody else or many other people seem to think it's not going to work out, and if it did, it would be bad. The Internet is a great example of that. I would say it's f too buzzwordish these days to even go there, Chris, but artificial intelligence, I think, is just phenomenal development for humanity. I really I'm so excited about the possibility just like any powerful tool, the Internet being a recent example, it will be used for good, and yet, the headlines always seem to be about the negatives and the fears about AI replacing jobs and AI making bad decisions and guiding us, making us all stupid. The list goes on of skepticism about AI. While I would have also been skeptical about aspects of the Internet back in the day, we're not happy go lucky, Pollyanna ish. We can't see any downside to things, but I would say, in general, when I hear negativity around artificial intelligence, I think, Yeah, that makes me want to buy a little bit more.\n\nChris Hill: Speaking of negativity, one of the things you write about is the concept of dark clouds that if you as an investor can see through the dark clouds that are hovering over an industry or a company, that can be an incredible competitive advantage. One of the examples you cite that I vividly remember is when Disney bought Marvel. Paid billions for it. There were people skeptical of the price Disney was paying. And I remember being in the office talking with you about it, and you said, Don't look at the price. Don't look at the price tag. Look at the underlying intellectual property. Marvel has the intellectual property rights to literally thousands of characters. That's God knows how many TV series and movies and that sort of thing. Is there a business today that you look at that has some clouds around it getting attention, and it makes you think to yourself, because of the clouds, a lot of people are missing fill in the blank.\n\nDavid Gardner: Well, I think that this is an ironic and funny answer, but as some of these great Rule Breakers have become really big, the world starts rooting against them. This is kind of a natural American, especially for the Americans, listening. This is a cheer on the underdog and we start to, you know, hate on Facebook. Even though 2 billion people are using it, it ends up being always in danger of negative publicity, what's Zuck doing, etc. We see the same thing around Jet Bezos and the same thing around Elon Musk a weird part of me wants to point out that these are all phenomenal companies that are doing mostly good most of the time in this and at scale and are for profit and are creating huge amounts of jobs and possibilities for all of us that we're probably taking for granted. Part of me wants to say a dark cloud is hating on the rulemakers. I wouldn't, but, you know, I'm not a fan of every big company, but especially ones that are innovating, and I think that's such an important point for rule Breaker investors. It's always Chris and everyone listening. It's always about who are the innovators out there? Companies like GE were once very innovative and then lost that, and sometimes they can start fighting back or Kodak starts fighting back against digital cameras because it's not going to have film, and that's a big part of their profit base. There is a natural tendency for some really big companies to get dodgy and slower. But I think a dark cloud is that I think we should appreciate and recognize greatness of these big companies, I throw Netflix in there as well. It's not quite as big as the others, but these big dogs are really taking us places that no one else can, and I think that's worth buying and holding.\n\nChris Hill: Well, and part of that negativity only part, but it is part. Part of it has nothing to do with the business or the people running it. Part of it just has to do with the market cap of the company. There are always going to be those investors on Wall Street who say, Well, look, how much bigger can this thing get? They cite the I think it's the law of large numbers, which I think we need to revisit the law of large numbers.\n\nDavid Gardner: You're right. They do cite it, and they're incorrectly citing it when they use it, but keep going.\n\nChris Hill: No, but I think that is part of the negativity. And it is part of the argument against companies the size of Apple, Facebook,Microsoft, etc.\n\nDavid Gardner: Well, let me jump in with one level down because when I think about Rule Breakers, they're not all Apple yet. But within their industries, a company like Exxon Enterprise, the former Taser, providing great tools for law enforcement nationally, increasingly globally. Phenomenal company passes the SNAP test, which you referenced earlier, an important little section of the book. Intuitive Surgical. Robotic surgery, robot assisted surgery, the DaVinci surgical robot. Most people, I submit, if you tap them on the subway or ask them at a cocktail party, Hey, ever heard of Intuitive Surgical? Most people are going to say no. That is such a good sign for investors. I think looking at companies that have Blue Ocean opportunities, no one is really competing with them. They're not as big as Apple. They're not as well known as Facebook. Yet, you can see the rule Breaker in and, you know, both of those particular companies are stocks we've held for a long time and rule Breakers. A lot of listeners have one or both of those companies, and the dark cloud I can see through there is people just not being willing to allow technology to do all that it really can. People were skeptical of the taser. Doctors were very skeptical of the Davinci surgical robot, especially if there were older doctors who didn't want to be trained in it. I think especially love finding situations where people are doubters or haters around companies that are using technology to do better things.\n\nChris Hill: Just like on this podcast in the book, you don't shy away from stocks that you've picked that have gone down that are significant losers, 50% or more, that sort of thing. One of the things I've wondered about in the past is because you're a very even keeled person. I've wondered about sort of like how you think like Medication, Chris.\n\nDavid Gardner: It's incredible. But she stuff I stuck I use.\n\nChris Hill: I have had the thought before it. But when David's in private, it's [laughs] just him and he's looking at his portfolio when he sees a.\n\nDavid Gardner: Kombucha. It's the power of Kombucha, my friend.\n\nChris Hill: Well, it turns out the answer is something you shared in the book, and I'm going to directly quote from one of my favorite passages of the book because it was informative to me. You're right. When a stock of mine struggles, I prefer to let it recover on its own. You got yourself into this mess, I fume, the scolding parent. Now, get yourself out of it. I know you're not in the habit of looking back, but you've talked about rule fakers, faker breakers. Is there one in your past that you look back on and you think, but I really thought that one was going to make it. I'm genuinely surprised that that one didn't turn out to be a little bit better and a little bit bigger.\n\nDavid Gardner: I could almost pick an entire sector, Chris, because when I've dipped my toe into the biotech pool, I find myself frequently falling into it altogether because there was no water in there, and I thought that there was. People told me, It's OK. The water's fine. But think about a company like Moderna. This is a phenomenal company. It saved a lot of lives. It came up from a standing start nearly during COVID, it found the vaccine that saved lives. You'd think Moderna, which we recommended at $81 in January of 2021, right in the face of it. It was a monster winner. Over the succeeding couple of years, you'd think that that would have been a really good stock pick. I now see five years later, well, almost five years, we're down 83% with Moderna, and that was a winner. I write about this some in the book. I've watched Amazon go from 95 down to seven. We watched Netflix drop two thirds of its value during Quickstar Those are happy stories of companies that turned it around, but there are any number GP, didn't work out so well for me. Any number of companies where each time that I picked a stock for the Motley Fool, I was like, I like this stock. I would buy this stock, and many of them, I did. Our money's where our mouth is generally the Motley Fool. I usually go in with some weird combination of confidence, but I guess I would say humility. I just know I'm wrong about some of my picks. I just can't figure out which ones before I pick them. I think part of being a rule-breaker, I hope, part of being a rule-breaker investor is recognizing that you are going to have some huge winners that turn to losers. You're also going to have some flat out losers. But best of all, you're going to have some huge winners, and that final group wipes out all your previous examples. Another one that comes quickly to mind, Chris, 3D systems. 3D printing, literally, up eight or nine times in value after one year of our pick, and we ended up selling at a significant loss. Yeah, each of these is a promising company out front with a new technology. They don't always pan out.\n\nChris Hill: I'm assuming there are people out there who if they know a little bit about your stock picking, what they know is surface level. That's the guy who bought Amazon in 1997. He bought Netflix in the early 2000, that thing. But one of the things that this book demonstrates is your discipline as an investor, in portfolio construction, in reviewing on a quarterly basis. I mean, these are these are things that you lay out for the reader. Did your father lay the groundwork for that discipline or is it something that you developed in other ways?\n\nDavid Gardner: Well, that's very kind, and I would say I don't actually think of myself as a particularly disciplined person. If I have discipline in me, some of it must come from my parents. Perhaps some of it is genetic, but most of it I'm going to attribute to a past guest on this podcast, David Allen, who wrote a wonderful book called Getting Things Done, that I read somewhere around 2003 or four, which means I was basically in my mid to late 30s and I felt incredibly disorganized. I had a young family, which you've had at the same time, Chris, right along with me, very busy growing business and professional life. I just felt like, I'm just a mess. I'm not organized. Encountering Getting Things Done, the GTD system, for me, if there's any discipline in me, it comes from some of the learning from that very simple, very readable book that I hope stands the test of time because it's been so helpful for me. Of course, books like Atomic Habits in recent years, huge seller for James Clear, also a guest in this podcast. I want to bring authors on to this podcast this week accepted that will be incredibly practically helpful for listeners, not just for your investing or your business, but your life. Again, if there is any discipline in this capital F fool who doesn't think he's particularly disciplined, I credit it to GTD.\n\nChris Hill: But just to push back a little bit, I mean, there's a section in this book about portfolio construction, and you write about the importance of diversifying both by industry type and company size. You're also quick to point out that people shouldn't feel necessary to invest in absolutely every industry. This question comes under the umbrella of invest the way the world is going. What are one or two industries of which you would say, people really should be invested in this industry. If you look at your portfolio and you don't see this industry reflected, you need to change that.\n\nDavid Gardner: There's a combination for me of obvious answers to that question that may be boring to give the answers on this packs, but I'd still give them. The Internet, I think you've heard of it, companies that have really achieved dominant positions serving the world, whether it's Amazon or Apple, but even one level down salesforce, Shopify. I mean, these are all companies that frankly, each of the companies I just mentioned with the exception of of Apple didn't really exist 30 years ago. It's incredible. Or even Shopify, I mean, companies have sprung up in just the last 15 to 20 years ten plus years after the Internet started. I continue to love and look at the Internet as a source of great companies. Also, they're always just a click away, so I feel like I can research them a lot more easily. But then, I would almost say without filling it up with an industry or say AI is another one or something like that. I think looking at every industry and asking yourself, who is the most innovative company? Who is the top dog and first mover with innovation in that industry. You can go to a company like Chipotle. I mean, just healthier, fast casual food. There are a lot of Chipotle imitators, and Chipotle is absolutely a Rule Breaker. You think about a company like, Well, I already mentioned Exxon Enterprise or Intuitive Surgical, they are category leaders for what they're doing. They're in completely different industries. Trex has been a wonderful investment for rulebreaker investors. Talking about composite outdoor decking or, Old Dominion Freight Line, which is a brilliant, lighter than truckload logistics trucking company, where they don't really have unionized truckers because they treat their employees really well. Multigenerational family business, also Major League Baseball's sponsor. That's another great example of a Rule Breaker. Each of them is just a completely different industry that they hail from, but they're each the innovators. They're each the winners, and Chris Hill, what do winners do?\n\nChris Hill: They keep winning.\n\nDavid Gardner: They keep winning, not every single time and not every game, but that's the safest bet. You and I have grown up in a world all of us have where the most frequent financial disclaimer is past performance is no guarantee of future results, which is some of the worst advice you can ever encounter. Past performance is often the very single best indicator we have of future results. Yeah, the Rule Breaker in me can't not call that out. But I appreciate the question, and I tend not to go for industries as much as I like to bottoms up, pick individual companies and just look for who the winners are Tesla.\n\nChris Hill: You just reminded me of one of my favorite sayings, which is that the battle goes not always to the strong nor the race to the swift, but that's the way to bet.\n\nDavid Gardner: I love it. Since I think you've actually taken the time to read some of my book, and I really appreciate that, that horse racing analogies come very naturally to me, and I really love to think about horse racing, even though I can't really ride horses myself. I was always allergic. But some of the analogies that we can draw made me think of when you talked about the race to the swift and that's where the bet is, what I love about the stock market, and we feature this in the six principles of the rulebreaker portfolio later in the book. What I love about the stock market is you actually can bet during the horse race. You can go, You know what? Secretariat, baby, we are out front ten legs already, Chris Hill. I'm going down to the betting window right now, and I'm going to put it on secretariat what do winners do? But so much of the world thinks secretariat has already won or is about to trip and fall, or I don't know, there are other fears that people introduce. The whole race is going to change in the middle, and secretariat won't do very well. We have been so well rewarded with Rule Breakers, not every type of company, not cyclicals, not faker breakers, but with Rule Breakers, you get to invest the whole race.\n\nChris Hill: You get to just like in horse racing, I suppose, you get to bet on multiple horses. When I was looking at the home improvement industry and was thinking, Oh, should I buy Home Depot or Lowe's? Finally, it just occurred to me like, Oh, I can buy both.[laughs] I don't have to choose which one that is the leader or I think is going to overtake the other. I just I can buy shares of both.\n\nDavid Gardner: It's absolutely true. Just to heal, This is not a story I tell in the book. I've told it once or twice in the podcast. I'll just go back there briefly again. But I made the mistake of betting on just one of the two horses in an important industry to me, back in the day, the 1990s as a lifelong video gamer that continues in my late 50s, but I recognize the benefits of graphical cards that we could insert in our PCs and have better graphics for our video games. I decided a company called 3D FX was going to be my horse. They had a rival that I was actively cheering against because it was like North Carolina and, or I don't know, Notre Dame and Southern Cal. Who is Notre Dame's rival? But anyway, I was there going, I got my guys. We're going to take down these other guys. The other guys happened in 3D FX's industry to be NVDA. I was actively not investing in cheering against NVDA, as not only did it win the race, it literally bought out my company for a song at a later point, showing that I'd clearly bet on the wrong horse. Had I bet on both horses, I would be even happier than I am today, but I am also awfully happy that I got over my rivals and my envy, and I decided in 2005 on Tax Day to recommend NVDA stock to Motley Full Stock Advisor members. You get to invest the whole race. You should invest in more than one horse. I actually like buying if you're talking about a good field like the Kentucky Derby, I like buying all 22 of them. 22 is not a bad number to start a portfolio. 20 stocks or so I think is a great way to start a portfolio these days. Yeah, don't get too hung up on Home Depot. They're going to crush Lowe's or just vice versa, you're right. They're both winners. That's one other very capital F foolish point to underline, which is that too many people think life is zero sum, and it's all about trade offs. If I win, that means you must lose. We see that in sports. You and I are a huge sports fan, so we know one team wins, the other team loses. That's not true in business, and that's definitely not true in life. Life is much more a co up game. We're all trying to win together and help each other win.\n\nChris Hill: I want to go back to AI for a second, because you provide some helpful tips in the book about how investors can use AI to track their stocks, review their portfolio. What role do you think AI will play in actual stock picking? Because there are plenty of people who look at the universe of investing and think, I'm just going to have a robot do this for me.\n\nDavid Gardner: Yeah, and I would be the first to say, go for it. If you see ways that artificial intelligence can improve your life, make better decisions, possibly lower your costs or both, or a third thing that floats your boat, I would say, go for it. I personally don't think that AI is going to pick stocks in any magical new way that beats the market better than you or I might. I think there are two key reasons for that for me, anyway. The first is that AI has already been trying to beat the market for the longest time. It's not like AI just showed up in the financial markets. As soon as we developed the computer, somebody started trying to make their computer trade on the Internet. Without them being around and make money for free, and believe me, at scale that has occurred over the last 30 years, at massive scale, most of the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ today is algorithmic computer driven. It's not dumb computers. They've been trying to make those computers as smart as they can not just last year with Chat GPT. No. For the last 30 years. If you have been investing well and beating the market over the last 30 years, I think there are very good reasons that will continue. In part, Chris, it's because AI is on both sides of the trade. If AI, by the way, were only on one side of the trade, I'd start saying, let's go with the AI, because the other side is not going to be as smart. If AI is all the buyers that I'm like, we're with the buyers. The sellers are going to be wrong, it's going to be a buying frenzy. Let's go with the AI. But AIs are on both sides of so many trades today. You can see AI trading against itself. Usually in an incredibly short term way. There isn't enough long term data to really feed into AI to know for certain what's going to beat the market over 25 years. But if you talk about the next 25 minutes, people have all kinds of Coca Amy schemes as to how they're going to make a lot of money in the next 25 minutes. Most of CNBC's coverage, most of the market media's coverage, Chris, as you well know, is all about today. Chris Hill, you still like Cloud computing stocks after yesterday?\n\nChris Hill: After yesterday?\n\nDavid Gardner: We've had experiences like that. I write about that in the book. We don't need to go there right now if you don't want to, but the unbelievably short term view of the vast majority of market coverage and the computers that are driving the volume mean I feel very comfortable in my little Rule Breakery space sitting. I'm not going to say above the fray. I'll just say aside from the fray, playing the same game. But by completely different standards with a totally different approach. In the same way that Moneyball came along and started saying, we actually think the way people are reading baseball, they're misunderstanding the real value being created out there. They just count batting average. They don't look at the walks hitters are drawing, and they don't recognize the value of that or the quality of the hit with slugging percentage, etc. Baseball has advanced so much in the last 30 years because people started asking smarter questions that were real. I think a lot of the questions around AI and market trading are just so short term, they're irrelevant to you and me. Actually, I think they hold others back.\n\nChris Hill: I want to ask you a couple of questions about the book Write Large and the process of writing it, because I know that one of the areas of your life where you are disciplined is note taking, and that was helpful to you in writing this book. But was there any part of the book that surprised you as it came together?\n\nDavid Gardner: Thank you. First of all, I so loved writing it. I think the most surprising thing to me was truly I didn't need deadlines. My brother Tom and I have written a number of books in the past. I'd never written a full book myself. I wrote halves of lots of books that I love doing. But the truth was always that I needed deadlines. I was like, I'm the guy who pulls the Double all nighter to get it in there on time. That's sad. I expected fully having not written a book ever purely by myself and having not written any book for 15 years, I started thinking, it's going to be that all over again, but I'm just going to go through with it because I really want to finish this final stock market book for me, and I loved writing it. I had so much I had way more material than I could ever use. I did take a lot of notes. I had 15 years of notes. I organized them in an Excel spreadsheet row by row with the talking point that I wanted to include in the book, and then I started rating and ranking each of them based on how good I thought the point was. That was one way to score it. The other way I scored my spreadsheet, talking points was, if I don't say it, will anyone else ever say it? Of course, I gave tens zero to ten. I gave tens to the points where if I don't say it, I don't think anybody ever will, and if everybody else is saying it, I tend to give that a one, two or three and not include it in the book. Yeah, I think the biggest surprise for me was I had so much fun writing it, I didn't need any deadlines.\n\nDavid Gardner: There were other surprises that came. I guess one I'll refer to very quickly is I decided after finishing Part 1 of the book, as a non-fiction book, I think we all feel some pressure to summarize the points that you've made in Part 1 of the book. You're going to have a section that summarizes with bullets what we've just gone over. There are three parts to the book. And I decided, You know what? I'm going to break the rules a little bit here. I'm just going to write a story. I'm going to make the points, if you've read them, implicit, if you look carefully within a little story that I'll tell. I had so much fun as somebody who majored in creative writing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I had so much fun just constructing a simple story of people that we can relate to who are Rule Breaker or not at all. Then as I finished Part 2, and 3 of the book, I realized, I'm going to continue that story, and that was not something I was ever planning. I actually loved doing that. That's a unique part of the book. I don't think many investing books have a fable that is serially continued through the book. It's not a huge deal. It's not the tail that wags the dog, but that was a surprise.\n\nChris Hill: This strikes me as one of those books, and I will just say for context, for anyone who's hearing my voice for the first time or the first time in a long time, I've encountered hundreds and hundreds of books about investing and money and business, because in all my years of hosting Motley Fool Money and Market Foolery, my name got on the distribution list of major publishers. I would say somewhere between 15-20 books per month would come to my desk and I would glance through them, and maybe one out of 20, I would think, oh, this seems worth talking about. No shade against the authors of the other 19 books. I'm sure they were perfectly fine, but it's a little bit like the point you were just saying of, if everyone else is going to say this, I don't know that I necessarily need to say this as well. All of that is context to this question. I think this is one of those books that people are going to give as a gift. They're going to buy it for themselves, but they're also going to give it to a gift because there are plenty of people who are interested in investing, and then there's a level below them. Like, everyone who's a stock market investor, has at least three friends who they pay lip service to being interested. They're not as interested, but they feel like maybe they should be, so they'll talk at a barbecue or a cocktail party, just like, hey, so how's the investing thing? That thing. I think yours is one of those books that investors are going to read, and then they're going to give it as a gift to their friend who needs to learn a little bit more. What should they say to their friend? How should they promote this book when they hand it to them?\n\nDavid Gardner: First of all, that's really kind, and thank you, Chris. Second, I hope that they would recognize that we are all investors. At that barbecue, they're surrounded by 20 others. All 20 of those people are investors. But if you actually ask that group of people, raise your hand at the barbecue. If you are an investor, maybe only those three people that that person was connected to or was thinking of would say, OK, yeah, I'm an investor. But truly because you've been around the Motley Fool just about as long as I have, you know that democratizing this subject, making it accessible to people. Reminding us that it's not just an investment of money you're making. We're all investors of time. We all have the same number of hours in the day. You're constantly investing in your own learning or not. You might be misusing the allocation of funds and time that you have. I suspect and hope most listeners wouldn't say they are, but I think all of us, me included, would say, I probably could do that. I probably could make slightly better use of my money or slightly better use of my time, at least. I hope that feeling of handing the book over to a friend and saying, hey, I think you'll get something out of this. I think the fun thing about this book is, well, I see it's my final stock market book, which it is, it's really a book about life and investing and leadership and entrepreneurship. It's ultimately there to connect with whoever's reading it at a human one to one level, not talking down at all, and not holding myself up as some great exemplar, a statue that you should imitate.\n\nYou should try to take on the form or pose that I have with the statue of this book. I hope that person would know they're giving it to somebody saying, I think you'll see something in this that will make you a little bit smarter, happier, and richer. You know that's been the Motley Fool's purpose for now 32 years in counting. I'm just happy that it'll be a book that can be shared. It's been a long time, and I've kept those notes that I referred to over 15 years. I've wanted to do this somewhere 2016\/2017, and I was like, I'm going to write. I'm going to write it this year. It didn't happen, and then COVID. I had an excuse. I can't do anything during COVID. But at a certain point, I said, If I get struck by lightning, my biggest regret as I lie there frying, I'll look up at the skies and say, why didn't I write this book? I was getting notes for it for more than a decade. Fortunately, I was not hit by lightning and fortunately a labor of love from last February to last August. It takes about six months to write a book. Takes about a year, as you well know, working within the industry as you have. Takes about a year for that book actually to show up to the public. I'm just so glad that I did it, and I would love it if anybody shares it with a friend. Also, forget about that image of me frying, being hit by lightning. That was not necessary. I know it's an audio medium, Chris, but it's also a visual medium, in a way, and I don't feel good about that. Can you quickly replace that in listeners Minds with something else?\n\nChris Hill: The standard go to is getting hit by a bus, which doesn't involve frying, but it's not necessarily better.[laughs]\n\nDavid Gardner: Let's move on.\n\nChris Hill: Before we get to buy seller Hold, two things I want to hit. The first is the glossary, which was this delightful surprise at the end of the book. You have a glossary of terms, and I'll just read a couple because they're just fun. For sports betting, you define it as one great, big, huge waste of money unless you're the house. For the word trading, you define trading as spending lots of time trying to make money, maybe half the time.[laughs] What is the origin story of the glossary?\n\nDavid Gardner: Well, somewhere near the end of writing the book, I started realizing there are a lot of terms that I've invented or repurposed. We have our own Rule Breaker vocabulary. We don't need to talk about spiffy pops this week authors in August, because I think most of our regular listeners know what I mean when I say spiffy pop. But if you say that to a crowd assembled anywhere, you'll get only a couple of hands that go up. I do point out in Rule Breaker vesting that in the urban dictionary, yes, spiffy pop exists in the urban dictionary, but not yet in the Oxford. But we're headed there. But I'm inventing words as we go. Even Rule Breaker, what is that exactly? I realize Rule breakers take two forms. They are the companies that we invest in, and they are you and me. If we're investing like a rule Breaker. I realize it's important to put definitions to some of these terms. Most of it is a summary of what you've already encountered in the book, but it's a handy, I don't know, six, seven, eight page alphabetical list of Rule Breakery terms that serve as a good summary and reminder for people. Yes, I'm trying to make you laugh at different points. I really do think that trading is spending a lot of time, trying to make money, maybe half the time. You obviously see what I think of trading. Sports betting has shown up in recent years, Chris Hill. I know you know that as a fellow sports fan. I've placed a sports better to myself, not just in the last few years, but in the last few decades when I guess I don't know, it was illegal. I've never used a bookie. I just bet with friends, but sports betting is not a good idea. It's not a good way to spend money, and the amount of money that is being bet these days, and I love ESPN, Disney property as of today still. But ESPN reimagining its own coverage of sports to constantly include the numbers of the bets. This is a very bad financial allocation. Chris Hill, you and I bet. You're betting Boston College. I bet my Bill Belichick led North Carolina Tar Heels. One of us is going to win, one of us is going to lose, and the house is going to make 5-10%, which means if you run the numbers, you and I will tend to lose money over time when we bet on sports. That is such a bad allocation and bad message. Yeah, a $64,000,000,000 industry or so last year, we're calling it out in the Rule Breaker Investing glossary.\n\nChris Hill: My last thing is inspired partly by the glossary, but also other parts of the book. This is an idea I'm going to share with you. If you want to run with this, if you want to get together with your publisher and run with this. It's merch. It's specifically Rule Breaker madness because early in the book, you talk about the four most dangerous words are buy low, sell high, and really instar people should buy high and try not to sell. I'm more than semi serious in this regard, because the thing is, David, these outdated maxims, I low sell high. You never go broke taking a profit. They are still ingrained in the everyday lexicon of investing. I think Rule Breaker magnets would provide daily reminders for investors to fight against the things that they're hearing from coworkers or family members who aren't investing as much as they are, and all they know to do is just repeat those tired old maxims that don't really work anymore.\n\nDavid Gardner: I really appreciate that point. They don't exist yet. There might be a whole industry. Chris, you and I are a little bit free agents. We're not as fully employed as we were maybe 10 years ago. Maybe we go together on this whole magnet business thing. But I really appreciate you calling out. I do part of my style as a writer is, I don't know, every three or four pages in this rather short book, you're going to see a bolded line because I try to punch home lines from time to time, and it's generally those kinds of merch magnet driven possibility lines that I greatly favor. Just before the glossary near the end, there's a things to remember, a couple of pages that just takes some of those maybe magnet lines and tries to capture them all in one place I know, for fellow Rule Breakers.\n\nChris Hill: Let's go to Buy sell or Hold.\n\nDavid Gardner: I would love to play.\n\nChris Hill: This is something any investor can create for themselves. Buy sell or Hold stock watch list.\n\nDavid Gardner: I am a big fan of stock watch list, so I say buy. I think that these days you can track them, whether it's on our site or on another site, back in our day, Chris, and I don't want to date us here, but we used to have to write that stuff down on paper and then look up in the newspaper the next day where the stock price was traded to keep up with the watch list. Not only that, but there are more fascinating companies today and more new innovations and discoveries worth watching. We can't own them all, or we can't own them all at once. Stock watch lists are a great tool, and I'm a listy person, anyway. I just like lists.\n\nChris Hill: Just two years removed from making the playoffs, your favorite baseball team. The Minnesota Twins are currently in fourth place in their own division, and let's face it, they'll need a small miracle to make the playoffs this season. Buy sell or hold the Twins getting to the World Series in the next five years.\n\nDavid Gardner: I'm going to say sell, and I am a lifelong Minnesota Twins fan. I watch almost every game. Last week, when the Minnesota Twins lost once again two out of three to the Yankees in Yankee Stadium, reflecting on the last 37 games played in Yankee Stadium, I believe the Twins are literally six and 31. Out of the last 37 games in Yankee Stadium, the Twins have won six. Last week, I think the Nadir of the Twins season was when they were one hit losing to the Yankees 9-1, and the Twins pitchers Little League baseball, if you will, the Twins pitchers literally walked 11 Yankees as we were one hit. I watched that whole game, and I started asking myself, am I misallocating my own time?\n\nChris Hill: Why am I watching?\n\nDavid Gardner: It is so painful to experience that to lose so many games to the Bronx Bombers that clearly, I don't know, Minnesota Nice might have an inferiority complex around, but if we're really playing the odds, the odds of any team making the World Series the next five years would be lower than 50%. I would even include the Yankees or Dodgers there. Twins chances much lower than that. Sell.\n\nChris Hill: I'm so old. I remember being told these vehicles will be ubiquitous in 2025, buy sell or hold self-driving cars.\n\nDavid Gardner: [laughs] You and I did a podcast once that will re air in about 20 more years or so. We did it from the future. I think the year was 2052, and part of what we did with that podcast from the future co-hosted by Chris Hill and David Gardner for Rule Breaker Investing is we look backwards from 2052 and just looked back at what had happened. You and I found to our surprise, I think, somewhat humorous surprise that self-driving cars still weren't really a thing. It's like the new iPhone in 2052. Better camera. But yeah, I would say that even though we said that from 2052, three years ago, I think I'm starting to become more of a buyer. I'm going to call a hold on this because I have owned Teslas for 13 years, several different ones. Up until about two years ago, I was like, this thing I would never allow to drive. It couldn't recognize stop signs or red lights in urban settings. Within the last two years, it's actually gotten pretty effective. Most of the time, I still drive myself. I enjoy driving. But, Chris, I do think we might be wrong on one prediction we made from the year 2052. I'm going to say hold on the whole self-driving thing.\n\nChris Hill: You've mentioned your alma mater a couple of times. Buy sell or hold, a successful season for University of North Carolina football coach Bill Belichick.\n\nDavid Gardner: It became not just a sports story, became really a national story. Then it was exacerbated by romantic relationships and all kinds of other off field developments. I think, though, what did we say earlier, Chris, about winners? I actually think that Bill Belichick is a winner. I would be taking the over if we were doing sports betting and talking about how many wins the nation now expects North Carolina football, not a topic of previous interest to anybody to have in the year ahead. I'm not even sure what that is. But if people think the Tarsus would be about 500, I'm going to say maybe a game or two above that, because I actually really think Bill Belichick is very smart and a very good football coach.\n\nChris Hill: You've written this publicly, and you've also mentioned it during this conversation, referring to rule Breaker investing as \"my final stock market book.\" Buy sell or hold, David Gardner writing another non-stock market book in the next 10 years.\n\nDavid Gardner: I'm going to say buy on that with a belief that that will happen sooner rather than later. I'm not going to be somebody who comes out with a new book every year or two or wants to be a lifetime author. There are a few songs that I want to sing, and I feel like if I don't sing them, nobody might, and I hope that they'll add value to the world. This is my most important book. I don't think any book I'll write in future if I do will be more important than Rule Breaker Investing. But there is something just about breaking the rules, period. About that approach that we've taken to investing, that actually works in other contexts as well. The contexts I think all the time about on this podcast are investing in business and life. I think if this book is well received and people would like it, and if they won't, I won't do it. But I could imagine writing a book about breaking the rules, just in a more general way. Won't be a stock market book. This is my stock market book, but I guess I'm a buy on that.\n\nChris Hill: The book is Rule Breaker Investing. How to pick the best stocks of the future and build lasting wealth. It is available on September 16th, but you can order it now in all formats, including audiobook, and you should, because it's a terrific read, and if you allow it to, this book will make you a better investor. David Gardner, thank you so much for surrendering the host chair this week and enabling me to join you on the Rule Breaker Investing podcast.\n\nDavid Gardner: Chris, there's nobody. I'd rather take that seat from me for the first time in the history of this podcast. Congratulations on your work with money Unplugged. You have a lot of Fools and a lot of non-Fool fans. They might not even know about the Motley Fool who enjoy following you and your work, and I'm one of them. I'm honored to have you this week on Rule Breaker Investing. In conclusion, I am honored by your presence, and Chris, I feel as if we didn't screw it up this week. Like, that line that you called out recently that I may or may not have said on this podcast.[laughs] I think we're OK. We're good.\n\nChris Hill: I think this was a good conversation, but people will email you. Listeners will weigh in.\n\nDavid Gardner: [laughs] Chris Hill, thank you so much and Fool on.\n\nChris Hill: Fool on.\n\nMary Long: As always, people on this program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Molly Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.
