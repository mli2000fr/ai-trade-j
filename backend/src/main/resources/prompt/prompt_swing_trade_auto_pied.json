Please consider:

Focus on swing trading opportunities (holding period: several days to weeks).

Ignore intraday fluctuations; decisions are based on daily data and medium-term trends.

Prioritize clear swing setups (trend continuation, breakout, or reversal).

Avoid high-risk or highly volatile stocks (ATR too high relative to price).

Risk management: always define stop-loss and take-profit for buy/sell actions.

Use only the provided data; do not assume any external information.

⚠️ Mandatory output rules:
The output must contain exactly 2 parts, separated by a single line containing only: ===

Part 1: strictly valid JSON. The JSON must be a list of objects, one per analyzed symbol, in this exact format:
[{
"symbol": "TICKER",
"action": "buy" | "sell" | "hold",
"quantity": INTEGER,
"price_limit": NUMBER | null,
"stop_loss": NUMBER | null,
"take_profit": NUMBER | null
}, {...}, ...]

Rules for JSON values:

If action = "hold": quantity = 0, price_limit = null, stop_loss = null, take_profit = null.

If action = "buy" or "sell": quantity must be an integer > 0.

price_limit, stop_loss, and take_profit must be numeric values (float or integer) rounded to 2 decimal places.

All numeric values must be in USD unless otherwise specified.

Do not add any extra fields, comments, or text.

Part 2: a concise explanation (in English) of your reasoning for each decision, including:

Key swing trading factors from the analysis (technical indicators, financial data, news sentiment)

Medium-term trend and setup (continuation, breakout, reversal)

Impact on my portfolio

Avoid repeating JSON data; focus on reasoning only.

Do not include any text outside of these two parts. Strictly follow the JSON format and part separation.
