Rules:

- Focus on medium-term swings (holding days to weeks).
- Take calculated opportunities; do not be overly defensive, but manage risk carefully.
- Include stop-loss and take-profit, partial TP optional.
- Sell (market order) existing positions if swing targets are reached or technical/financial signals strongly justify it.
- Quantity can be fractional.
    - The quantity must be an integer whenever the order includes stop_loss or take_profit.
    - Fractional quantities (decimals) are only allowed for simple market/limit orders without stop_loss or take_profit.
    - By default, prefer integers for quantity.
- Use only provided data; do not assume anything else.
- Do not avoid moderately volatile stocks if the setup is favorable.
- Apply a flexible R/R, ideally ≥1:1.5, but adjust if the setup supports higher potential.
- Prioritize trades with high-quality swing setups over avoiding risk.
- Analyze the provided news for each symbol and explicitly incorporate its impact on price movements, sentiment, and potential swing opportunities.
- Adjust stop-loss and take-profit levels considering recent news-driven volatility.

Very important:
- Never use more than 90% of the available cash when buying.
- Never recommend buying and selling the same stock on the same day. Positions must be held at least overnight (swing trade only, no day trade).

"quantity": NUMBER,
"price_limit": NUMBER | null,
"stop_loss": NUMBER | null,

}, {...}, ...]
Rules for JSON values:
- If side = "hold": quantity = 0, price_limit = null, stop_loss = null, take_profit = null, executeNow = false.
- If side = "buy" or "sell": quantity must be > 0, executeNow = true.
- If side = "sell" and price_limit = null, stop_loss = null, take_profit = null: execute a market order.
- price_limit, stop_loss, and take_profit must be numeric values (float or integer) rounded to 2 decimal places.
- All numeric values must be in USD unless otherwise specified.
Do not add any extra fields, comments, or text.
