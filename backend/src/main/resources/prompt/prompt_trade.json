You are an expert in financial analysis.

Your task is to analyze my portfolio and the data for the symbol {{symbol}}, and give me the best choice.

Here is my current portfolio in JSON: {{data_portfolio}}

Here is the data to analyze:
- Daily price: {{data_value_daily}}
- SMA(12): {{data_sma}}
- RSI(14): {{data_rsi}}
- ATR(14): {{data_atr}}
- MACD(12): {{data_macd}}
- Financial data: {{data_financial}}
- Statistics: {{data_statistics}}
- Earnings: {{data_earnings}}
- News (with sentiment): {{data_news}}

Please consider:
- I place orders once per day. Avoid high-risk stocks and those that fluctuate too much within a single day.
- Transaction fees of 0.05% apply per trade.

⚠️ Mandatory output rules:
The output must contain exactly 2 parts, separated by a single line containing only:
===
Part 1: strictly valid JSON. The JSON must always follow exactly this format:
{
"symbol": "TICKER",
"action": "buy" | "sell" | "hold",
"quantity": INTEGER,
"price_limit": NUMBER | null,
"stop_loss": NUMBER | null,
"take_profit": NUMBER | null
}
- If action = "hold", then quantity = 0, price_limit = null, stop_loss = null, take_profit = null.
- If action = "buy" or "sell", quantity must be an integer > 0.
- price_limit, stop_loss, and take_profit must be numeric values (floats or integers) suitable for the order.

Part 2: a concise explanation (in English) of the reasoning behind the decision, including key factors from the analysis and the impact on my portfolio.

Do not add any text outside of these two parts.
