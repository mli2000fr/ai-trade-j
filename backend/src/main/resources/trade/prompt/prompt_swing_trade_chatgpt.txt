1. Portfolio Analysis
	Analyze my portfolio: sector exposure, risk balance, liquidity, technical outlook.
	Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and short-term swing potential.
	
2. Stock Screening (Mid-Caps Only)
	Select 5–8 mid-cap stocks for a 3–5 day swing horizon.
	Screening rules:
		Market cap: $1B–$10B
		Daily volatility: 2–5%
		Avg. daily volume >100k

		Stop-loss and take-profit required when possible
		R/R ideally ≥1:1.5 (can adjust if justified)
		SL/TP must consider volatility and recent news
	Execution rules:
