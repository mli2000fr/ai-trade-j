Create a 3-4 day swing trading plan for 8 real, liquid mid-cap stocks ($1B–$10B, volatility 2–5%, average daily volume >100k) from at least 4–5 sectors.

Explain why each stock is suitable for a 2–3 day swing, highlight short-term momentum, risk/reward, and suggested stop-loss zones. End with a summary table: Ticker, Sector, Market Cap Type, Key Technical Signals, Stop-Loss, Risk/Reward. Use most recent public data, fully formatted and ready to copy-paste.
